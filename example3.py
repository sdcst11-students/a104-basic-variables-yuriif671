Before you run this program, make sure that you have created your 'launch.json' file in the Run and Debug section of the Activity Bar. Then, click on the space to the left of line 7 (The one with the title of this program).  You will see a red dot show up when you mouse over it.  If you click on the dot, it will turn to a brighter red.
This creates a "breakpoint" in the program, or a point where the program pauses when you run and debug.  When the program reaches this point, it will pause and wait for you to continue working through the program.  You will notice a panel at the top of the screen that has an option to step into the program.  Notice how you can see the variables displayed in the debug panel as you do so.  You should notice the value of x change as you reach and pass line 11.
